# Predicting Protein Fold State
### Lucas Ramadan

This is a project I undertook while completing my Masters' Degree in Data Science from galvanizeU. 

I created a Neural Network for our Advanced Machine Learning course, which includes Convolutional and Recurrent Layers, including GRUs and LSTMs. 

I also created Probabilistic Graphical Models to compare, including a simple Naive Bayes model for benchmarking, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and soon, a Continuous Random Field (CRF).
