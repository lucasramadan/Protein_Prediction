### To-Do
- [x] convert tab separated files to csvs, for ease of importing
- [x] convert csvs to np tensors, for convolutions
  - [ ] redo, once reconstruct initial sequence state
- [x] reconstruct sequence from windowed data
- [ ] split sequences by individual proteins
- [ ] reconstruct initial sequence state
- [ ] construct windowed proteins
- [ ] create positional features, for PGMs
- [ ] port Theano work into Keras
- [ ] combine scripts into single package
